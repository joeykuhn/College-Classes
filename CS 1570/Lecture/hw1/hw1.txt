Description: Homework 1: Algorithms

Algorithm #1:
Step 1) Each person checks if they are holding their own student ID. If they
do, the student steps aside; otherwise, they form a circle
Step 2) If the circle contains no people, GO TO (4)
Step 3) Each person passes the ID they are holding clockwise and then GO
TO (1)
Step 4) Output 'Every person is sorted'

Algorithm #2:
Step 1) If the initial input is a string, convert it into an integer
Step 2) base12 = the result of converting the input into a integer
Step 3) base10 = 0 //the result
Step 4) Break the base12 number into n amount of digits
Step 5) digit[0..n] = resultant digits from breaking up base12
Step 6) counter = the highest index of digit (noted n in step 5)
Step 7) if counter => 0 then base10 = base10 + digit[counter] *  12 ^ counter, counter = counter - 1, and GO TO (7) else GO TO (8)
Step 8) Output "The number", base 12, "is equal to", base10, "in base 10"

Algorithm #3:
Step 1) If first inputted word or second inputted word is empty string output "Not a valid input" and END PROGRAM
Step 2) Break up the first inputted word into its individual letters and put it in the variable wordOneLetter[1..n]
Step 3) Break up the second inputted word into its individual letters and put it in the variable wordTwoLetter[1..n]
Step 4) counter = 1, total = 0
Step 5) valueWordOne = lexographical value of wordOneLetter[counter], valueWordTwo = lexographical value of wordTwoLetter[counter]
Step 6) if valueWordOne == 0 and valueWordTwo == 0 then GO TO (9) else GO TO (7)
Step 7) if the valueWordOne == valueWordTwo then counter = counter + 1 and GO TO (5) else GO TO (8)
Step 8) total = absolutevalue(valueWordOne - valueWordTwo)
Step 9) Output "The lexographical difference is", total
